# Government Services MCP Servers

This directory contains information about MCP servers related to Indian government services and digital public infrastructure.

## Digital Public Infrastructure

India has built world-class digital public infrastructure (DPI) including Aadhaar (identity), UPI (payments), and DigiLocker (document storage). These systems serve as the foundation for digital service delivery across the country.

## MCP Servers for Government Services

There is significant potential for MCP servers that integrate with India's government services, though many are still in development or conceptual stages:

### Existing Initiatives

1. **[india-stack-mcp](https://github.com/openindia/india-stack-mcp)** - A proof-of-concept MCP server that provides interfaces to various India Stack services.

### Potential Development Areas

The following areas represent significant opportunities for MCP server development:

- **Aadhaar Integration**: MCP servers that securely interface with Aadhaar for identity verification
- **DigiLocker Access**: Servers that enable AI assistants to retrieve verified documents from DigiLocker
- **Government Services**: Integration with services like passport application, PAN verification, and other e-governance portals
- **Public Data Access**: Servers that provide structured access to government open data portals

## Development Considerations

When developing MCP servers for government services, keep these considerations in mind:

- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with all relevant government regulations and API guidelines
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures for handling sensitive government data
- **Privacy**: Respect user privacy and data protection principles
- **Authentication**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms as per government APIs
